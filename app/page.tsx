            <h4>*TOUCH UPS*</h4>
            <p>1st touch ups are always required to complete your new look. 1st touch ups that are over 1 year of initial new service are at the rate of a new service for all artists. We also recommend annual touch ups to maintain your brows as they tend to fade over time. Annual touch ups are also subjected to different rates depending on when you last visited. Touch up prices are not included in the new service/corrections/cover-up prices. Touch ups are an additional charge per service and the rates are dependent on each artist and the time it has been since your last visit . Additionally, we reserve the right in adjust prices as needed without prior notice. </p>

            <h4>*DEPOSITS*</h4>
            When booking your appointment, you will be asked to place a deposit for your service. This deposit will be applied to your total fee that is due the same day of your appointment. Deposits are non-refundable and non-transferable. Non-refundable means, once you place the deposit, any cancelations for any reason will not be refundable. 

            <h4>*LATE POLICY*</h4>
            Appointments will be canceled and no refunds will be given if the client is more than 15 minutes late to their appointment. Artists take multiple clients a day and need the full amount of time for each appointment. You may schedule a new appointment, but will need to place another deposit.

            <h4>*RESCHEDULING* </h4>
            Rescheduling appointments will only be possible if the artist is given at least one week notice prior to your scheduled appointment. Due to limited appointment availability, we may not be able to reschedule your appointment until a much later date. Promotional rates may change if you reschedule your appointment to a later date. If you are rescheduling your touch up the rates will change depending on what time frame you schedule your new appointment (use price lists as reference). If you are rescheduling within one week of your appointment date you will not be able to transfer your deposit to a later date and deposits will be forfeited. A new deposit will need to be made when rescheduling a future appointment if it is within a week of your scheduled appointment. 

            <h4>*CANCELLATION & NO SHOW*</h4>
            Any appointments canceled within one week of the appointment date will not be able to transfer deposit to a later date and deposits will be forfeited. Same-day cancellations or no-shows will be charged for the price of the full service.

            <h4>IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS CONCERNING MEDICAL CONDITIONS PLEASE CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE SCHEDULING YOUR APPOINTMENT </h4>

            <h4>DO NOT BOOK AN APPOINTMENT IF: </h4>
            You are under the age of 18 
            You are pregnant or nursing 
            You are taking blood thinning medications 
            You have viral infections or diseases
            <h4>*BEFORE YOUR APPOINTMENT*</h4>
            No coffee or other stimulants 
            No alcohol or other blood thinners 
            No retinol skincare products
